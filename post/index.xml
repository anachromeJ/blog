      <description>This is the first in a series of posts about the inner workings of Linux, partially inspired by linux-insides. I&amp;rsquo;m starting with a review of basic computer architecture. I find it easy to lose track of the fundamental building blocks of a computer when you are operating at a higher level of abstraction. Plus I don&amp;rsquo;t think schools necessarily cover all of this in a typical CS program (or maybe they do but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying attention).</description>

      <description>Enough with the Spamming: Enforcing Email Frequency Caps This is something I did at work, posted to Medium. It talks about challenges involved in preventing our services from sending too many emails to the same address quickly.</description>

      <description>The other day I saw a tweet about blog posts it would be great to see, and one of them was &amp;ldquo;inside PostgreSQL: how a join works internally, what makes it fast&amp;rdquo;. Coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;m taking a course on database system implementation, and I thought this would be a great way to study for my midterm! Of course, by the time I&amp;rsquo;ve finished this post, the midterm is long gone, but it was still a great incentive for me to start writing :)</description>

      <description>I originally started this blog as a graduate student while I was at Columbia, in the hopes of putting my spare time to better use. Now it&amp;rsquo;s just a rarely updated dumping ground of half-written articles :)
This site uses Hugo. The theme is Hugo Xmin.</description>
