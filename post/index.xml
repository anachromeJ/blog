      <description>I realized that if I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep every article in the blog well thought-out and organized, it&amp;rsquo;d take me several full days to complete each one. The result is that my last article was over a year ago, and I may never finish another one again. I still want to keep this blog alive, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to use it as a dumping ground for my finished / unfinished technical writings.</description>

      <description>The other day I saw a tweet about blog posts it would be great to see, and one of them was &amp;ldquo;inside PostgreSQL: how a join works internally, what makes it fast&amp;rdquo;. Coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;m taking a course on database system implementation, and I thought this would be a great way to study for my midterm! Of course, by the time I&amp;rsquo;ve finished this post, the midterm is long gone, but it was still a great incentive for me to start writing :)</description>

      <title>Why This Blog</title>

      <description>This is probably my last year as a student, when I still have a lot of freedom allocating my time. In the hopes of putting my spare time to better use than playing Witcher 3 and Hearthstone, I decided to start writing some technical articles. This would be a good opportunity for me to do some research into things I never dedicate enough time to understand, and hopefully benefit whoever chances upon this little blog :)</description>

      <title>What Happens When You Press the Power Button on Your Linux Computer</title>

      <description>I wanted to start a series of posts on how the Linux operating system works, inspired by linux-insides, but instead of covering the entire operating system which is way too much work for my lazy ass, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on several aspects of the OS and try to do a good job explaining them &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to make this comprehensible for someone who&amp;rsquo;s seen some assembly and C, but isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily familiar with the internals of an OS.</description>
