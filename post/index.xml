      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is probably the last year of my student life, where I still have a lot of freedom allocating my time. In the hopes of putting my spare time to better use than playing Witcher 3 and Hearthstone, I decided to start writing some technical articles. This would be a good opportunity for me to do some research into things I never dedicate enough time to understand, and hopefully benefit whoever chances upon this little blog :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to start a website for ~3 years now, and as I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to find out, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;unbelievably&lt;/em&gt; easy to spin up something like this. No wonder everyone has their own blog these days and they all look so pretty (I&amp;rsquo;m currently using Hugo, Github Pages and Namecheap for this site).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
