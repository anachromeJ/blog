<p>This used to be an unfinished rant/post from when I <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/administrative-processing-information.html"><em>crashed</em></a> into some free time in 2019. At the time I&rsquo;ve been working at BigCo for a year, so I reflected on what I&rsquo;ve learned a bit. Now, another year later, I&rsquo;ve finally found the time to finish it.</p>

<p>Opinions my own and does not represent those of my employer, etc etc.</p>

<h2 id="company-culture">Company Culture</h2>

<p>I think most of the things people say about BigCo&rsquo;s culture are true, but experiencing it helps me put them into perspective. Here are some remarks I recall during my conversations with other people about BigCo:</p>

<ol>
<li>BigCo is an engineer&rsquo;s heaven.
This very much depends on what your idea of an engineer&rsquo;s heaven is. Is it a place where you&rsquo;re surrounded by smart, experienced engineers with a focus on code quality?</li>
<li>Working at BigCo is like living in a sandbox. You don&rsquo;t really get to experience this kind of working environment outside of it.
I think the connotation here is that it is great as long as you are here, but the culture doesn&rsquo;t prepare you for other workplaces.</li>
<li>BigCo hires smart people and don&rsquo;t care about much else.
I&rsquo;ve certainly seen people here that are not very socially well-adjusted (which may very well include myself), but are extremely intelligent.</li>
<li>People are driven by promotion criteria instead of doing real work.
I think there is more to this. As a company gets bigger, there comes a point where what benefits an employee and what benefits the company diverge. Promotion is a very powerful tool to re-align those things, but it can only do so much.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="acronyms">Acronyms</h2>

<p>Some famous scientist (Feynnman?) once expressed his dislike of acronyms. When I started here I very much agreed with that sentiment. In my first few months, I must have encountered more than a hundred acronyms and project nicknames there were completely foreign to me. For the first handful, it felt fine to ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s X?&rdquo;, but as time wore on, it got to a point where I felt like I should know most of these things, but didn&rsquo;t, and I became more hesitant to show my ignorance. I got into this game of trying to decide which acronym would make me look relatively less ignorant before I asked what it is. Obviously, not my proudest moment.</p>

<h2 id="software-rewrites">Software Rewrites</h2>

<h2 id="c">C++</h2>

<p>Writing C++ with sufficient library and tooling support is night and day from writing your own little C++ program from scratch. Before coming to my current employer and starting to write C++ professionally, I&rsquo;ve only had intro-level experience with the language, writing programs for university assignments. That was not a pleasant undertaking. I think multiple factors contributed to this - lack of modern C++ features, lack of library support, and lack of build tools. You needed to figure out how to write a Makefile, how to give gcc the right flags to make some ancient feature work, how to manually manage memory, how to convert between C-style strings and C++-style ones, how to join strings together for debugging, etc. Compare this to the Python&rsquo;s simple builtin primitives or Java&rsquo;s library support, and you get students and maybe even professors who don&rsquo;t want anything to do with C++.</p>

<p>Overall I think learning C++ has been worth my time. It&rsquo;s really like learning three or four different languages. You are learning OOP, generic programming, concurrency paradigms, memory management without a GC, templates, and probably lots more. The result is that after a year I still have no idea what the heck I&rsquo;m doing, but I know more than I did before.</p>

<p>I definitely could not have caught up to the best practices of this language on my own time. I&rsquo;d say C++ is complex enough to warrant the 10,000-hour rule. You need to spend a <em>lot</em> of time with it just to be <em>productive</em> (or in other words, not accidentally run into some rabbit hole of cryptic template errors consuming your entire afternoon), much more so than probably any other langauge, and you won&rsquo;t have that kind of time unless you make it part of your day job. In fact, even if you do, it&rsquo;d still take years of experience before you can reasonably say you&rsquo;re familiar with the common pitfalls of the language. This is why hundred-page <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">style</a> <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md">guides</a> exist. It&rsquo;s not like you could internalize the contents of these without dedicating a significant portion of your career to them.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve bumped into open-source code written by PhDs at top CS programs who&rsquo;ve done multiple internships at BigCo, and there are still blatant misuses of language features. It just speaks to the complexity of the language.</p>

<p>Ok, enough with the rant. Despite all the above, I still think that, if you have the time to go through with all of it, C++ is a hard-to-replace, constantly improving and occasionally even like-able language. It&rsquo;s statically typed which makes it manageable in a huge codebase; it gives you as much control over the system as you want; it supports every programming style out there so you can pick your own poison; big software companies have invested heavily in it so it&rsquo;s slowly morphing into a modern language.</p>

<p>Another nice thing about C++ is the immense educational value it carries.</p>

<p>Of course, future me might come back here, read this, and then laugh at my desperate attempt to justify wasting all this time on an ancient language. But you never know!</p>

<h2 id="complex-systems">Complex Systems</h2>

<p>Complex systems can be <em>really</em> complex.</p>

<p>Before starting my new job, I thought I was prepared to take on the complexity of whatever software project was thrown my way. It was only a matter of time before I could fully grasp the inner workings of a system.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand intuitively why the complexity of a system can easily surpass any single person&rsquo;s comprehension. Software is developed by people, and the complexity of a system can easily become proportional to the number of people behind it. Despite this, we have developed such nice abstractions around software, that it&rsquo;s easy to fall prey to the illusion that we can understand just about anything other people have built.</p>

<p>Working at a company of this scale definitely set my perspective straight here.</p>

<h2 id="datacenter-networks">Datacenter Networks</h2>

<p>Before coming to BigCo I had the computer networks knowledge of an average college grad in computer science. I had taken one course on computer networking, and it struck me as rather uninteresting, so I didn&rsquo;t spend much more time learning about it. I actually think my lack of interest at the time was rather justified, given that this is a relatively &ldquo;slow&rdquo; progressing field compared to some other branches of computer science. Also, &ldquo;protocols&rdquo;, &ldquo;standards&rdquo;, &ldquo;RFCs&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t exactly the sort of things to get you excited about a topic. I mean, have you seen the hype around this thing called machine learning? Sometimes it even masquerades as AI. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to study AI?</p>

<p>That said, I&rsquo;ve realized that when it comes to interests, I have to force myself a little. I thought the database course I took as an undergrad was boring, and I now read about database research occasionally for fun. I thought networking wasn&rsquo;t interesting, and yet I went to NSDI 2018 and couldn&rsquo;t be happier about it.</p>

<p>As is turns out, there is lots of active research around computer networking! For example, one of the hot topics is RDMA, which allows to treat computers on the other side of the network as just another built-in device. Another topic is datacenter network topology, which can be a very mathy problem - there are tons of network switches in a datacenter, and you want to find a way to arrange them so that they&rsquo;re connected with sufficient redundancy to increase reliability, and you want to do it with as few switches as possible, and the physical wiring among switches have to not be a maintenance disaster (personally I have trouble managing the wires behind my TV).</p>

<p>Frankly it&rsquo;s quite fascinating.</p>
