      <description>I wanted to start a series of posts on how the Linux operating system works, partially inspired by linux-insides, but instead of covering the entire operating system which is way too much work for my lazy ass, I&amp;rsquo;ll just focus on several aspects of the OS which I find interesting and may have taken me more time to grasp compared to other things.
My motivation for doing this is mainly to learn more about Linux.</description>
