      <title>Transitioning to Notebook Style</title>

      <description>I realized that if I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep every article in the blog well thought-out and organized it&amp;rsquo;d take me several full days to complete each one. The result is that my last article was over a year ago and I may never finish another one again. I still want to keep this blog alive, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to use it as a space for notebook-style writings. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll still be useful to strangers on the Internet, and if not I&amp;rsquo;ll just be happy there&amp;rsquo;s a public repo of what I used to know at one point in my life :).</description>

      <title>Why This Blog</title>

      <description>This is probably my last year as a student, when I still have a lot of freedom allocating my time. In the hopes of putting my spare time to better use than playing Witcher 3 and Hearthstone, I decided to start writing some technical articles. This would be a good opportunity for me to do some research into things I never dedicate enough time to understand, and hopefully benefit whoever chances upon this little blog :)</description>
